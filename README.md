## Credits
I got the source code from https://git.bootcampcontent.com/Ohio-State-University/OSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-01-2024-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/03-JavaScript/02-Challenge?ref_type=heads

I used https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/display-popup-message-in-javascript to figure out how to do pop-ups for the criteria boxes

I used https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math to figure out how to make the password generator choose random characters from the characters I listed

I used https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp to figure out the format for the 'if' statements.
